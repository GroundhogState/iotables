# Structural Path Analysis and Path Exchange Project


A project to explore and develop input-output techniques to use structural path analysis (SPA) in application to the Path Exchange Method

## Organisation
notebooks: Developing concepts/features/tests

* iotable_integration: io analysis suite. Design of the basic class(es?) isn't totally clear yet.
* pld_demo: SupplyChain, could be a subclass of IOTable. Steering the IOTable towards xormulation as an xarray, in stages. 
* spa_dev -  pathfinding and tree-unrolling parts of SPA.
* product decomposition: Implementing some theory from [Wieland et al](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09535314.2017.1350831)

## Data

* Only data on git are some tutorial tables. Approach with caution, no flash photography.

## Uses:
* xarray, pandas
* [prior work by Andr√© Stephan and Paul-Antoine Bontinck.](https://github.com/hybridlca/pyspa)
* Other work as cited in code
